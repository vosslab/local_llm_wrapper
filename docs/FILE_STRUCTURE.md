# File structure

## Top-level layout
- `AGENTS.md`: Agent workflow and environment constraints.
- `LICENSE`: Project license text.
- `README.md`: High-level description of the wrapper.
- `llm_generate.py`: Repo-root CLI helper for quick prompt tests.
- `docs/`: Project documentation, style rules, and planning notes.
- `local_llm_wrapper/`: Core Python package for the wrapper.
- `tests/`: Pytest tests and lint/ASCII compliance scripts.
- `devel/`: Developer helper scripts.
- `ai_image_caption/`, `automated_radio_disc_jockey/`, `biology-problems-website/`, `llm-file-rename-n-sort/`, `screenshot-ai-renamer-macos/`, `simple-llm-openai-wrapper/`: Symlinked sibling repos that are ignored by git.

## Key subtrees
- `local_llm_wrapper/transports/`: Backend transport implementations and protocol.
- `tests/`: Pytest files named `test_*.py` plus repo-wide lint scripts.

## Generated artifacts
- `ascii_compliance.txt` and `pyflakes.txt` are generated by the test scripts and ignored by git.
- `XML_PARSE_FAILURES.log` is written by `local_llm_wrapper/llm_utils.py` when parses fail.

## Documentation map
- `docs/` holds long-form docs; see [docs/REPO_STYLE.md](docs/REPO_STYLE.md) and [docs/MARKDOWN_STYLE.md](docs/MARKDOWN_STYLE.md).
- Root-level docs remain limited to `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `AGENTS.md`.
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` is the user-facing change log.

## Where to add new work
- Add wrapper code in `local_llm_wrapper/`, and new transports under `local_llm_wrapper/transports/`.
- Add tests under `tests/` and keep them deterministic.
- Add docs under `docs/` and follow [docs/MARKDOWN_STYLE.md](docs/MARKDOWN_STYLE.md).
- Add developer scripts under `devel/` and avoid new top-level folders unless needed.
